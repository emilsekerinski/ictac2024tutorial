# A Formal Look at Programming

*Emil Sekerinski, November 2024*

**Training lecture presented at [ICTAC 2024](https://ictac2024.cs.ait.ac.th/)**  

This training lecture provides an introduction to the classical theory of program correctness:
- Sequential programming
- Modularization (object-oriented programming)
- Robustness (exceptions)
- Concurrency (including semaphores and message passing)

These lecture notes
- use a visual formalism to be programming language independent,
- explore the algebraic structure of programs,
- connect the theory and common programming languages with interactive Jupyter notebooks.

The target audience is:
- students starting with formal methods or interested in strengthening their programming
- instructors looking to teach a more rigorous approach to programming.

The lecture material is accessible and available as an open educational resource. It includes a collection of exercises covering theory and programming.

The lecture notes come as Jupyter notebooks. There are several ways to run the notebooks:

Juypter has two user interfaces: Classic Jupyter (one notebook per browser window) and JupyterLab (multiple notebooks per browser window). This tutorial uses *JupyterLite* with *JupyterLab*.
