    "Programming is a difficult design discipline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Complexity:* Complex engineering products are designed by dividing them into parts and subparts, with specialists being involved in different parts, e.g. in the construction of a village or vehicle. Now contrast this with programming a computer with a one gigahertz processor that executes one instruction in each cycle. A programmer has to specify 10⁹ instructions for a one-second computation. If we define the complexity of a problem as the orders of magnitude between the whole and the smallest parts –some sort of logarithm of the ratio– no other design discipline comes close.\n",
    "- *Discreteness:* Analogue devices are governed by mathematical continuity, which implies that a sufficiently small change in the input will result in a small change in the output. The discrete nature of digital computers does not allow such a relation; flipping a single bit of the input does allow us to predict anything about the change of the output, hence questioning the value of testing."

    "> Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do. [Knuth (1984)](#References) on *Literate Programming*\n",

    "Jupyter notebooks support *interactive literate programming*: *code cells* with program pieces and *markdown cells* with prose are interleaved. Rather than embedding prose as comments in the program, prose and program pieces have an equal visual status. As explanations and programs are adjacent, they are easier to keep in sync."

    "Knuth's WEB system (which predates the World Wide Web) for literate programming is meant for languages like Pascal and C: Prose and code “chunks” are interspersed, and WEB assembles the code chunks into a self-contained program for compilation. While there are exemplary program developments with WEB in the literature, neither WEB nor related tools caught on widely. Interactive notebooks like Jupyter allow individual cells to be executed, so avoid the step of assembling a program for compilation. The code cells are executed from top to bottom, unlike with WEB, where chunks can be arranged in an order that may be more natural. Jupyter is particularly suited for Python and functional languages, where programs can be compact and require explanation. Notebooks are commonly used for *data science*. Here, we use notebooks for both lecture notes and exercises. "

    "> Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence! [(Dijkstra 1960)](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD249.PDF)\n",

    "This quote had a profound impact on the understanding of programming, program correctness, and teaching programming. Starting in the '70s, several textbooks on structured programming and program verification came out: [(Wirth 1972)](#References), [(Dahl et al. 1972)](#References), [(Dijkstra 1976)](#References), [(Gries 1981)](#References), [(Dijkstra &amp; Feijen 1988)](#References), [(Cohen 1990)](#References), [(Kaldewaij 1990)](#References), [(Apt et al. 2009)](#References) (first edition 1991), [(Hehner 2024)](#References) (first edition 1993). [Dijkstra (1984)](#References) argues that computing education needs radical change to be effective; the article is still worth reading today. However, in the 90s, there was a growing recognition that programs became remarkably reliable–or at least sufficiently usable–without proof [Hoare (1996)](#References), even if imperfect. A solid understanding of the foundation of programming remains indispensable to achieve efficiency, small size, and elegance."
