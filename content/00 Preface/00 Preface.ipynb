    "Ray tracing is a technique to render raster images of a three-dimensional scene, e.g. in animations. For all image pixels, rays are traced \"backward\" from the camera (eye) until they hit an object in the scene. From there, the reflecting and refracting rays are traced until they hit a light source. This process is recursively repeated as objects may be in the shadow of other objects. The colour and intensity of a pixel are then calculated based on the reflecting and refracting properties of the traced objects and the light source's colour. The run-time for each pixel is proportional to the number of light sources, proportional to the number of rays spawned by every object hit, and exponential in the depth of the recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "As light rays do not influence each other, all pixels of a frame and all frames of an animation can be computed in parallel. With 4K resolution (3840 × 2160 pixels) and 24 frames per second, a 110 min animation needs 1.3 × 10¹² pixels to be computed. For all rays needed for one pixel, the intersection of the ray with any object needs to be determined."
