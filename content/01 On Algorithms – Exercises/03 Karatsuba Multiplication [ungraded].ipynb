    "Multiplication of (very) long numbers is a core operation in many computer applications. Long multiplication of numbers with `n` digits requires `n²` digit multiplications; generally, multiplication is considered to be significantly more \"expensive\" than addition. Therefore, we count only the number of digit multiplications and ignore the number of additions. For years, `n²` digit multiplications were believed to be necessary until Karatsuba in the 60s showed that long multiplication can be done with fewer digit multiplications. See the Wikipedia entry on [Karatsuba_algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm) for a description of the algorithm and the history of its discovery. \n",

    "Referring to the terminology of that article, multiply `2138 × 4079` using `B = 10` and `m = 2`. This requires the multiplication of other numbers with two digits. Use Karatsuba's algorithm for multiplying those as well with `B = 10` and `m = 1`, for which you only need single digit multiplications. How many single-digit multiplications did you use in total?"

    "**Hint:** If `x0`, `x1`, `y0`, `y1` are single digit numbers, then in `(x1 + x0) × (y1 + y0)` the factors `(x1 + x0) and (y1 + y0)` may require more than a single digit. However, you can still count this as a single digit multiplication. More generally, if `x0`, `x1`, `y0`, `y1` are n digit numbers, the multiplication `(x1 + x0) × (y1 + y0)` is considered to be an `n` digit multiplication."
