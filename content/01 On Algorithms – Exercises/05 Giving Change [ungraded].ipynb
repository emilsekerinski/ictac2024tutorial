    "Formulate the algorithm for giving change as a state diagram. Use the version with a single loop. Annotate the state diagram. Recall that depending on the denominations, the algorithm may not return the least amount of coins. A criterion that guarantees the least amount of coins is that each denomination is a multiple of the next lower one. Formulate this as a precondition for the algorithm. Recall also that the algorithm may not be able to give exact change if the least denomination is not `1` cent. However, that condition is too strong. For example, the algorithm would still work if the least denomination is `2` cents and the amount is even. What is a more general condition that has to hold for the amount and least denomination such that exact change can be given? State that as a precondition."
