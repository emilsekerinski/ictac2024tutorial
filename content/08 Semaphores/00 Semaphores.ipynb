The philosophers share a common dining room where there is a circular table surrounded by five chairs, each belonging to one philosopher. In the center of the table, there is a large bowl of spaghetti, and the table is laid with five forks. On feeling hungry, a philosopher enters the dining room, sits in his own chair, and picks up the fork on the left of his place.
