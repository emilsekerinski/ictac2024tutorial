    "So far, we have assumed that processes share memory: they may have local variables but communicate through global variables, including those protected by monitors. In _message passing,_ processes communicate by _sending and receiving messages_ over _channels_. Shared memory is not needed. As all variables are local to a process, mutual exclusion is guaranteed.\n",

    "- In _distributed systems,_ there is no shared memory in _ distributed systems: all communication is by passing messages. This is the case for geographically distributed systems and _\"thinly\" connected multiprocessors_. Examples are _hypercube,_ _systolic array,_ and _flexible interconnect._\n",
    "- Even when shared memory is available, message passing isolates processes, which may contribute to higher reliability and better performance. It makes the programmer's view uniform, whether processes are local or distributed. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)\">Mach</a> operating system kernel, on which [macOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Mach/Mach.html) is built, uses message passing between processes (although other communication primities were added over the years as well)."
